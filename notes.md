# ðŸ‘‘ðŸ’€: Monster

- Attacker can't dodge, dash, or any survival action, you are **doomed** to take the hit.
- Speed, Accuracy, and Strength

  - Speed: How fast you are with your weapon, how many swings you can do with your sword.
    - Number of initial dice you roll.
  - Accuracy: How likely you are to hit or come into contact with the monster you are fighting.
    - The number you need to get on those dice.
  - Strength: How strong you are, just because you can hit, doesn't mean you will wound the monster.

- Lantern 10 is always a hit (Accuracy) or a wound (Strength), but not always a critial wound when there is no critial wound on the hit location card.

Turn your miniature on its side. You may only spend survival to dodge (remaining knocked down), and cannot spend activation or movement.

If you were in the middle of your attack, the remainder of that attack is canceled. Turn your miniature on its side. Always stand at the end of the next monster turn. You may only spend survival to dodge (remaining knocked down), and cannot spend activation or movement.
